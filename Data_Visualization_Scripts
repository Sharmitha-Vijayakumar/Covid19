I've organized the code into a class-based structure that makes it easy to generate all visualizations. Here's what's improved from the original code:

## 1 Better Organization:

All visualizations are methods in a single class
Consistent styling across all plots
Centralized file handling
Creates a dedicated 'visualizations' directory


## 2 Enhanced Features:

Added error handling for file operations
Improved plot styling with seaborn integration
Consistent figure sizes and formatting
Better padding and layout management
Added grid alpha for better readability


## 3 Usage Instructions:
To use this code:

## 4 Save it as covid_visualizer.py

## 5 Ensure your data files are in the same directory:
Moving AVERAGE.xlsx
Project1.csv


## 6 Run the script:
