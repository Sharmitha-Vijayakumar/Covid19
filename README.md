# COVID-19 Mortality Rate Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the mortality rate of the COVID-19 pandemic using statistical techniques such as regression analysis, time series analysis, and moving averages. The goal is to understand the trends in death rates and predict future values.

## Background
In late 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, leading to a global health crisis. This project focuses on analyzing the death rate data and its economic impact across various sectors.

## Objective
1. Analyze the monthly death rate data of COVID-19.
2. Smooth out short-term fluctuations using a 3-month moving average.
3. Predict future death rates based on historical trends.
4. Assess the economic impact of the pandemic.

## Methodology
### Statistical Techniques:
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarize and visualize the data.
- **Regression Analysis:** Identify relationships between variables (e.g., death rate vs. time).
- **Time Series Analysis:** Analyze trends and forecast future values.
- **Moving Average:** Smooth out short-term fluctuations.

### Software Tools:
- Excel: For data organization and moving average calculations.
- SPSS: For advanced statistical analysis and forecasting.
- Python (Optional): For additional visualization and modeling.

## Key Findings
1. The death rate increased significantly during the initial months of the pandemic.
2. A second wave was observed in late 2020 and early 2021, leading to higher mortality rates.
3. Based on the 3-month moving average, it was predicted that the death rate would continue to rise unless strong preventive measures were implemented.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- SPSS
- Python (optional)
- PowerPoint
