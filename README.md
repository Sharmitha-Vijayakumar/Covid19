## Problem Statement
The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in significant mortality rates and profound economic consequences. Understanding the progression of death rates and predicting future trends are critical for policymakers and healthcare systems. This project aims to:

Analyze the monthly death rate data of COVID-19.
Predict future trends in death rates.
Assess the economic impact of the pandemic on industries such as agriculture, food processing, public transport, aviation, education, real estate, and retail.

## Objective
1. Analyze the monthly death rate data of COVID-19.
2. Smooth out short-term fluctuations using a 3-month moving average.
3. Predict future death rates based on historical trends.
4. Assess the economic impact of the pandemic.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
Source: Secondary data collected from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other published reports.
Time Period: January 2020 to March 2021.
### Statistical Techniques Used
Descriptive Statistics: To summarize and visualize the data.
Regression Analysis: To identify relationships between variables (e.g., death rate vs. time).
Time Series Analysis: To analyze trends and forecast future values.
Moving Average: To smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends.

## Key Findings
1. The death rate increased significantly during the initial months of the pandemic.
2. A second wave was observed in late 2020 and early 2021, leading to higher mortality rates.
3. Based on the 3-month moving average, it was predicted that the death rate would continue to rise unless strong preventive measures were implemented.

### Tools Used:
- Excel: For data organization and moving average calculations.
- SPSS: For advanced statistical analysis and forecasting.
- Python (Optional): For additional visualization and modeling.


## Results
### Death Rate Trends:
The death rate showed a significant increase during the initial months of the pandemic.
A second wave was observed in late 2020 and early 2021, with higher mortality rates.
### Forecasting:
Based on the 3-month moving average and regression analysis, it was predicted that the death rate would continue to rise unless strong preventive measures were implemented.
### Economic Impact:
Industries such as aviation, tourism, retail, and education faced severe disruptions due to the pandemic.
Agriculture and food processing faced challenges due to supply chain interruptions.

## Conclusion
### Based on the analysis:

The death rate of COVID-19 is expected to increase unless stringent preventive measures are enforced globally.
The second wave of the pandemic poses a greater threat and highlights the need for safeguarding vulnerable populations.
Vaccination efforts and public health interventions are critical in mitigating the spread and reducing mortality rates.33
